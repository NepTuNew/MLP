# MLP

Implement MLP(Multilayer perceptron) with python.
And do some visualize data from mutilple dimensions to two dimensions.

## Introduction

This project is the homework in the Neural Network class in National Central University.
Dataset are provided from this class and only used for learning.
Core practice is to implement the Backpropagation Algorithm and understand the formula.

## File Introduction

* main.py : Create gui and lanuch.
* model.py : Implement the Backpropagation Algorithm.
* data.py : Preprocessing the data.
* gui.py : Initial the GUI and do some control character.

## Precautions

* Only set hidden numbers to 2 can visualize the transform data.
* Only choose the Number.txt file can use the function of blue block(see Usage).
